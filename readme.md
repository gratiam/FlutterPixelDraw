# Pixel Painter

This is a simple flutter app that creates a grid of pixels the user can recolor to make simple designs or pictures.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. After cloning/downloading the repo, navigate to its directory in the console with `cd my/path/to/pixel\_draw`
2. Then type `flutter build apk`
3. Once it has been build, it will tell you the local directory of the file.
4. Download the APK.
5. Transfer to an android device (or use an android emulator)
6. Run the APK and install the app.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open the app by tapping it pixel-art icon
2. In the app, tap on a color button on the bottom and then on a pixel on the grid
3. To change colors, click another color button.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Android Studio (latest ver. with cmd-line tools and DNK installed)
* Flutter must be installed (check with `flutter --version` in the console)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Flutter API Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev) - Tons of good examples in article-like format; very readable
* [Flutter Tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/learn/tutorial) - Step-by-step walkthrough of a project.
* [Dart API Docs](https://api.dart.dev/index.html) - Helpful for those who, like I, don't know Dart very well.
* \+ A lot of googling

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* \[Color Buttons] All color buttons are in one row, making them inaccessible on tall screens.
* \[Tap \& Drag] Currently you must tap every tile; it would be nice to be able to click and drag over multiple tiles.
* \[Custom Dimensions] Being able to select how many tiles the grid should have, and even the size of the tiles.
